# Predicting Loan Defaults: An EDA Approach to Minimizing Credit Risk

This project leverages Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify key indicators of loan default risk within a consumer finance context, using data from 2007 to 2011. Through detailed univariate and bivariate analysis, we unveil patterns that help predict default likelihood, aiming to enhance lending decisions and minimize credit loss. Our findings offer actionable insights for financial institutions, contributing to more informed risk assessment and portfolio management strategies.

## General Information
- **Title:** Predicting Loan Defaults: EDA Insights into Financial Risk Management
- **Objective:** Utilize Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify significant predictors of loan defaults, enabling financial institutions to make informed lending decisions, reduce credit losses, and manage risk effectively.
- **Data Source:** The dataset spans from 2007 to 2011, encompassing a wide range of loan applicant information, including loan outcomes (fully paid, current, charged-off) and various borrower attributes.
- **Tools & Technologies Used:**
  - **Python:** For data processing and analysis.
  - **Pandas & NumPy:** For data manipulation.
  - **Matplotlib & Seaborn:** For data visualization.
  - **Jupyter Notebook:** For documenting the analysis process.
- **Key Findings:**
  - Identification of critical factors influencing loan defaults.
  - Insights into the relationship between borrower attributes and loan outcomes.
- **Potential Impact:** By identifying patterns and predictors of default, this project aids in minimizing financial risks, optimizing loan approval processes, and supporting the development of more robust risk management frameworks in the consumer finance industry.

## Conclusions
- **Loan and Funded Amounts:** Default likelihood increases for loans ranging from $2,000 to $12,000 and funded amounts from $3,000 to $11,500.
- **Interest Rate and Installments:** Loans with interest rates above 10% and fewer than 600 installments show a higher default risk.
- **Annual Income and DTI:** Borrowers earning between $30,000 and $60,000 annually with a DTI greater than 10 are more prone to default.
- **Total Payment and Recoveries:** A total payment under $10,000 and recoveries less than $1,000 correlate with increased defaults.
- **Collection Recovery Fee and Bankruptcies:** Lower collection recovery fees (under $200) and public record bankruptcies (below 0.15) are associated with higher default rates.
- **Loan Terms and Grades:** Shorter term loans (36 months) and grades B, C, and D are more likely to result in default.
- **Employment, Home Ownership, and Verification:** Borrowers with more than 10 years of employment, who rent or have a mortgage, and whose income is not verified, show a higher default risk.
- **Purpose and Location:** Loans for debt consolidation and those issued to borrowers in CA, FL, NY have a higher likelihood of default.
